Car recommendation system based on Genetic Algorithms using data from Brazilâ€™s FIPE vehicle pricing table. The algorithm optimizes car selection based on user preferences for features such as engine size, model year, price, and vehicle age, along with categorical attributes like brand, fuel type, and gear type.

Includes data preprocessing, normalization, one-hot encoding, full GA implementation (selection, crossover, mutation, elitism), and fitness evolution visualization.
